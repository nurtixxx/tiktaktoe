# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe with SFML  

Welcome to **Tic-Tac-Toe**, a fun and simple game made using **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**! 🛠️ This project is all about bringing the classic game to life with graphics, interactivity, and some playful bot action.  

---

## ✨ Features  

- **Play Against the Bot** 🤖  
  - Choose your symbol (❌ or ⭕) and make your moves on the grid.  
  - The bot responds with random moves, keeping the game light and unpredictable.  

- **Simple and Clean Interface** 🖼️  
  - A visually appealing 3x3 grid design.  
  - Easy mouse-based interaction—just click and play!  

- **Custom-Drawn Assets** 🎨  
  - All textures and graphics (grid, symbols, etc.) are hand-drawn by me! While they’re simple for now, I plan to upload polished assets in the future. Feel free to draw your own or improvise if you'd like!

## 🚀 How to Run  

1. **What You’ll Need**:  
   - Make sure **SFML** is installed on your system.  
   - Have a C++ compiler (C++17 or later) ready.  

2. **Textures**:  
   - For now, the textures are stored locally and are custom-drawn.  
   - If you want to try your own, draw a grid and symbol sprites (200x200 px each) and adjust the file paths in the code:  
     - `setkav2.png`: The game grid.  
     - `krestnol.png`: The player and bot symbols.  

   - I’ll update the project with better textures soon! 😊  

3. **Build It**:  
   - Compile the code with the SFML libraries. For example:  
     ```bash  
     g++ -o tictactoe main.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system  
     ```  

4. **Run the Game**:  
   - Execute the program and dive into the fun! 🎉  
     ```bash  
     ./tictactoe  
     ```

## 🎮 How to Play  

1. **Symbol Selection** 🎭  
   - When the game starts, pick your symbol by clicking on either ❌ or ⭕.  

2. **Make Your Move** 🖱️  
   - Click on an empty square in the 3x3 grid to place your symbol.  

3. **The Bot Responds** 🤖  
   - The bot will make its move immediately after yours, placing its symbol randomly on the grid.  

4. **Have Fun** 🎉  
   - The game doesn’t check for wins yet, but feel free to challenge yourself and improve it!

## 💡 What’s Next?  

Here are some ideas to take this game to the next level:  
- Add logic to detect wins, losses, or draws. 🏆  
- Improve the bot’s strategy so it’s smarter and more challenging. 🧠  
- Add a restart button to play again without restarting the app. 🔄  
- Include sound effects and animations to make the game feel even more alive! 🎵✨
